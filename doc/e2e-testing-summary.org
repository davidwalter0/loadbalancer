* E2E Testing Implementation

I've implemented a comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) testing framework for the loadbalancer project that verifies its functionality in a real Kubernetes environment. This framework:

1. Validates that the loadbalancer correctly processes Kubernetes resources
2. Verifies traffic forwarding to backend services
3. Tests advanced features like health checks and load balancing
4. Ensures reliability through shutdown and restart scenarios

** Framework Structure

The E2E testing framework consists of:

*** Core Framework (~test/e2e/framework/~)
- Framework initialization and configuration
- Kubernetes resource management (namespaces, services, pods)
- Loadbalancer process management
- Test environment setup and teardown
- Common utilities for test scenarios

*** Test Scenarios (~test/e2e/scenarios/~)
- BasicConnectivity: Tests basic service connectivity
- MultipleServices: Tests handling multiple services simultaneously
- EndpointChanges: Tests adaptation to endpoint changes
- HealthCheck: Verifies health check functionality
- LoadBalancing: Tests traffic distribution across backends
- ShutdownAndRestart: Tests resilience to process restarts
- ServiceUpdates: Tests handling of service property changes

*** Utilities (~test/e2e/utils/~)
- HTTP client for testing web services
- Network utilities for connectivity checks
- Helper functions for common operations

*** Test Runner (~test/e2e/e2e_test.go~)
- Parses command-line flags and environment variables
- Initializes test framework and environment
- Runs selected test scenarios
- Handles graceful cleanup on completion or failure

** Key Features

1. *Flexibility*: Configurable through environment variables or command-line flags
2. *Isolation*: Creates dedicated test namespaces for clean testing
3. *Comprehensive*: Tests all major loadbalancer functionalities
4. *Self-Contained*: Manages its own resources and cleanup
5. *Reliable*: Includes proper waiting and timeout handling
6. *Debuggable*: Option to preserve resources on failure for debugging
7. *CI/CD Integration*: Easy to integrate with continuous integration pipelines

** Make Integration

Added Makefile targets for convenient test execution:
- ~make e2e-test~ - Run all tests
- ~make e2e-test-basic~ - Run only basic connectivity tests
- ~make e2e-test-health~ - Run only health check tests
- ~make e2e-test-debug~ - Run tests without cleaning up on failure
- ~make e2e-test-ci~ - Run tests in CI environment

** Documentation

1. Comprehensive User Guide (~doc/e2e-testing.org~)
   - Detailed test usage instructions
   - Configuration options
   - Test scenario descriptions
   - Writing new test scenarios
   - Troubleshooting guide

2. Quick Reference (~test/e2e/README.md~)
   - Quick start instructions
   - Available tests and options
   - Prerequisites
   - Common commands

** Future Work

The framework is designed to be extensible. Some potential future enhancements:

1. *Performance Testing*: Add benchmarks and load tests
2. *Chaos Testing*: Simulate network failures and other disruptions
3. *Metrics Validation*: Test monitoring and metrics functionality
4. *Protocol Support*: Test additional protocols as they are implemented
5. *Security Testing*: Validate authentication and authorization features

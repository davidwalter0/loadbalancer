* Project Documentation and Diagramming

Comprehensive documentation has been created for the loadbalancer
project:

1. *Project Overview* (~/doc/overview.org)
   - System architecture analysis
   - Component breakdown
   - Current status assessment
   - Gap analysis
   - Recommendations for future work

2. *Architecture Diagrams* (~/doc/architecture-diagrams.org)
   - System component diagrams (using PlantUML)
   - Communication flow diagrams
   - State transition diagrams
   - Initialization sequence diagrams

3. *Technical Specifications* (~/doc/technical-specifications.org)
   - Detailed component specifications
   - Data flow descriptions
   - Implementation details
   - Performance considerations
   - Security considerations

4. *User Guide* (~/doc/user-guide.org)
   - Installation instructions
   - Configuration options
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting tips
   - Advanced usage scenarios

5. *Main README* (~/doc/README.org)
   - Project overview
   - Quick start guide
   - Architecture summary
   - Deployment instructions

These documents provide a solid foundation for understanding, using,
and extending the loadbalancer.

* Health Check Implementation

A robust health checking system has been implemented:

1. *Health Check Module* (~/health/*)
   - Support for TCP and HTTP health checks
   - Configurable check intervals and timeouts
   - Customizable healthy/unhealthy thresholds
   - Status tracking for endpoints
   - Service annotation-based configuration

2. *Integration with ManagedListener*
   - Dynamic endpoint health monitoring
   - Automatic endpoint registration/deregistration
   - Health-aware load balancing
   - Graceful handling of endpoint failures

3. *Health Check Documentation* (~/doc/health-checks.org)
   - Detailed feature description
   - Configuration options
   - Best practices
   - Monitoring guidance

The health check system improves reliability by ensuring traffic is only routed to healthy endpoints and provides better visibility into the status of backend services.

* Test Coverage Improvements

The test coverage has been significantly enhanced:

1. *Health Package Tests*
   - Unit tests for all health check functionality
   - Integration tests with real network services
   - Status transition tests
   - Edge case handling tests

2. *IP Manager Tests*
   - Comprehensive LoadBalancerIPs tests
   - Reference counting tests
   - IP address validation tests
   - Error handling tests

3. *Pipe Package Tests*
   - Connection handling tests
   - Data transfer tests
   - Lifecycle management tests
   - Error condition tests

4. *Manager Tests*
   - Service handling tests
   - Endpoint handling tests
   - Listener lifecycle tests
   - Configuration tests

These improvements increase confidence in the codebase, ensure
functionality works as expected, and help prevent regressions when
making future changes.

* Future Work

While significant improvements have been made, the following areas
could be addressed in the future:

1. *Additional Protocol Support*
   - UDP load balancing
   - HTTP/HTTPS with TLS termination
   - WebSocket support

2. *Advanced Load Balancing Algorithms*
   - Weighted round-robin
   - Least connections
   - IP hash-based persistence

3. *Monitoring and Metrics*
   - Prometheus integration
   - Connection statistics
   - Performance dashboards

4. *Security Enhancements*
   - Network policy integration
   - Rate limiting
   - mTLS support

5. *Performance Optimizations*
   - Connection pooling
   - TCP optimization settings
   - More efficient I/O patterns

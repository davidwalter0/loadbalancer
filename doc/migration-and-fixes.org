* Summary

I've completed the migration of the loadbalancer project to use go-cfg/v3 and fixed several compatibility issues with newer versions of the Go libraries. This document summarizes the changes made and the current status.

** 1. Migrated to go-cfg/v3

Successfully migrated the codebase to use go-cfg/v3:

- Updated import paths from =github.com/davidwalter0/go-cfg= to =github.com/davidwalter0/go-cfg/v3/pkg/config=
- Adapted API calls to the new v3 API:
  - Changed =cfg.AddStruct(envCfg)= to =config.NewManager().Load(envCfg)=
  - Removed =cfg.Finalize()= calls (now handled internally)
  - Updated =cfg.Usage()= to =config.NewManager().ShowUsage()=
- Updated go.mod to point to the new module
- Added replace directive for local development: 
  =replace github.com/davidwalter0/go-cfg/v3 => /home/david/org/go-cfg/v3=

** 2. Fixed Backoff Library Compatibility Issues

The backoff library API had changed:

- Updated =NewExponentialBackOff= calls to no longer pass a cancellation channel
- Removed references to the =StartTime= field which is now unexported
- Modified log messages to use available information

Files updated:
- =mgr/backoff.go=
- =mgr/listener.go=
- =mgr/open.go=

** 3. Fixed Kubernetes API Context Parameters

The Kubernetes API now requires context parameters for all client calls:

- Added =context= imports to relevant files
- Updated =client.Get= calls to include =context.Background()=
- Updated =client.Update= calls to include =context.Background()= and =metav1.UpdateOptions{}=

Files updated:
- =mgr/listener.go=
- =mgr/types.go=
- =examples/nodes/nodes.go=

** 4. Fixed Deprecated Kubernetes API Fields

Some fields in the Kubernetes API have been deprecated or removed:

- Removed =IncludeUninitialized= field from =ListOptions= in =mgr/manager.go=
- Replaced =Node.Spec.ExternalID= with =Node.Status.Addresses[0].Address= for node identification

** 5. Added Runtime Link Device Configuration

Made the link device configurable at runtime:

- Removed hardcoded initialization in =mgr/ipmgrinit.go=
- Created explicit =Initialize()= function
- Added validation of link device configuration
- Modified main.go to call =Initialize()= at startup

** 6. Created Network Interface Discovery

Added helper functionality to assist with link device selection:

- Created =ipmgr/interfaces.go= with interface discovery functions
- Implemented filtering logic to show only valid interfaces with IPv4 addresses
- Added example tool in =examples/listinterfaces/main.go=

** 7. Build Status

The codebase now builds with warnings about unused imports in two files:
- =mgr/manager.go=: "context" imported and not used
- =mgr/open.go=: "context" imported and not used

These warnings don't affect functionality and could be addressed in a future update if needed.

** 8. Next Steps

For a complete migration, the following items could be addressed in future updates:

1. Fix unused context imports
2. Add comprehensive unit tests for the new configuration functionality
3. Create more examples demonstrating the runtime configuration capabilities
4. Further modernize the Kubernetes client code

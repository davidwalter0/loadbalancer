* Migration Summary

I've completed the migration of the loadbalancer project to use go-cfg/v3 and made several improvements to the configuration handling. This document summarizes the changes and highlights the next steps needed.

** 1. go-cfg/v3 Migration

Successfully migrated the code to use go-cfg/v3:

- Updated import paths from =github.com/davidwalter0/go-cfg= to =github.com/davidwalter0/go-cfg/v3/pkg/config=
- Replaced API calls to match the new go-cfg/v3 interface:
  - =cfg.AddStruct()= → =config.NewManager().Load()=
  - =cfg.Finalize()= → (removed, handled by Load)
  - =cfg.Usage()= → (removed, generated automatically)
- Updated go.mod to point to the new module
- Added replace directive for local development

** 2. Runtime Configuration Improvements

The link device is now configurable at runtime:

- Removed hardcoded initialization from =init()= function
- Created explicit initialization that happens at application startup
- Added proper validation of link device configuration

** 3. Network Interface Discovery

Added new functionality to assist with link device selection:

- Created =ipmgr/interfaces.go= with interface discovery functions
- Implemented filtering logic to show only valid network interfaces
- Added an example tool in =examples/listinterfaces/main.go=

** 4. Known Issues and Limitations

The migration revealed several compatibility issues that need to be addressed:

1. *Kubernetes API Changes*: The codebase needs to be updated to work with newer Kubernetes API versions:
   - Context parameter required in client calls
   - Update options parameters needed for mutation operations
   - Removed fields (e.g., =IncludeUninitialized=, =Node.Spec.ExternalID=)

2. *Backoff Library Compatibility*: The backoff library API has changed:
   - =NewExponentialBackOff= signature changed
   - =StartTime= field is now unexported

** 5. Next Steps

To complete the migration and ensure full functionality, the following steps are needed:

1. Update Kubernetes client code to use current API
2. Fix backoff library compatibility issues
3. Add context support throughout the codebase
4. Implement more comprehensive error handling for configuration
5. Add unit tests for the new configuration functionality

The loadbalancer binary compiles successfully for the configuration components, but requires additional updates to the Kubernetes client code before it can be fully functional.

** 6. Benefits of the Migration

1. Better configuration management with the improved go-cfg/v3 library
2. Runtime configurability of the link device
3. Better user experience with interface discovery
4. Foundation for further improvements to configuration handling

* System Overview

The loadbalancer is a Kubernetes-native network proxy designed to provide external connectivity to Kubernetes services of type LoadBalancer. It manages external IP addresses on network interfaces and forwards TCP connections to the appropriate service endpoints.

* Architecture

** Core Components

*** Manager (Mgr)
- Central controller managing listeners for each LoadBalancer service
- Watches Kubernetes resources (Services, Endpoints, Nodes)
- Creates and manages TCP listeners for services
- Handles service lifecycle events

*** ManagedListener
- Handles a single LoadBalancer service
- Maintains connection to service endpoints
- Manages the lifecycle of individual connections (pipes)
- Updates external IPs on Kubernetes services
- Round-robin selection of backend endpoints

*** Pipe
- Bidirectional connection between client and service endpoint
- Handles data forwarding between connections
- Manages connection lifecycle
- Uses io.Copy for efficient data transfer

*** IP Management (ipmgr)
- Manages external IP addresses on network interfaces
- Adds/removes IP addresses from network devices
- Tracks reference counts for shared IPs
- Uses netlink library for network interface management

*** Kubernetes Watchers
- Watch for changes in Services, Endpoints, and Nodes
- Use workqueue patterns for rate-limited processing
- Provide events to the manager
- Filter for relevant resources

** Communication Flows

*** Service Discovery Path
- Kubernetes API → Watch Queue → Manager → ManagedListener
- Service events trigger listener creation/removal
- Endpoint events update target destinations
- Node events update available backend nodes

*** Connection Path
- Client → External IP → ManagedListener → Service Endpoint
- TCP connections are accepted and forwarded to backends
- Round-robin load balancing across endpoints
- Bidirectional data flow through pipes

*** IP Management Path
- Service creation → IP assignment → Network interface configuration
- Service deletion → IP removal (with reference counting)
- CIDR-based IP address management

** Design Patterns

*** Observer Pattern
- Kubernetes watchers observe API objects and notify components

*** Factory Pattern
- Component creation (ManagedListener, Pipe)
- Encapsulates component initialization logic

*** Decorator Pattern
- Middleware-like approach to connection handling

*** Controller Pattern
- Manager acts as controller for the system
- Central coordination of components

*** Command Pattern
- IP management actions encapsulated in functions

*** Exponential Backoff
- For retry logic in connection attempts
- Graceful handling of temporary failures

* Current Status

The system is functional with the following capabilities:

1. Kubernetes service integration
2. Dynamic endpoint discovery
3. TCP load balancing
4. External IP management
5. Graceful shutdown handling
6. Exponential backoff for retries
7. In-cluster and external cluster configuration

* Gap Analysis & Improvement Areas

** Protocol Support
- Only TCP is supported; no UDP or HTTP/HTTPS layer 7 features
- No TLS termination capabilities
- No protocol-aware routing or header manipulation
- No WebSockets support

** Load Balancing Algorithms
- Only simple round-robin is implemented
- No support for weighted, least connections, or hashing algorithms
- No session persistence/affinity
- No traffic splitting or canary deployments

** Health Checking
- No active health checking of endpoints
- Relies solely on Kubernetes endpoint updates
- No customizable health check parameters
- No circuit breaker patterns

** Metrics & Monitoring
- Limited observability
- No Prometheus metrics
- No detailed connection statistics
- No structured logging
- No tracing support

** Configuration
- Limited configuration options
- No dynamic reconfiguration without restart
- No annotation-based service customization
- Limited timeout and retry settings

** Security
- No network policy integration
- No connection filtering or rate limiting
- No authentication/authorization at load balancer level
- No mTLS support

** Performance Optimization
- Potential for optimizing the connection handling
- No connection pooling
- No TCP optimization settings (keepalives, timeouts)
- No traffic shaping capabilities

** Error Handling & Resilience
- Some error cases could be handled more gracefully
- Limited automatic recovery mechanisms
- Error propagation could be improved

** Testing
- Limited test coverage
- No comprehensive integration or performance testing
- No chaos testing or resilience verification

* Recommendations

** Protocol Enhancements
- Add UDP support for DNS and other UDP-based services
- Implement HTTP/HTTPS load balancing with TLS termination
- Support WebSockets and other protocols
- Add HTTP header manipulation capabilities

** Load Balancing Improvements
- Implement additional balancing algorithms (least connections, hash-based)
- Add session persistence options (cookie-based, IP-based)
- Support for priority and weights
- Implement traffic splitting for canary deployments

** Health Checking
- Implement active health probes
- Support customizable health check parameters
- Add circuit breaker patterns for failing endpoints
- Implement slow start for new endpoints

** Metrics & Monitoring
- Add Prometheus metrics endpoints
- Collect and expose detailed statistics
- Implement tracing for request flows
- Enhance logging with structured formats
- Add performance dashboards

** Configuration Flexibility
- Support service annotations for per-service configuration
- Dynamic configuration reloading
- More granular timeout and retry settings
- External configuration store integration

** Security Enhancements
- Implement connection filtering
- Add rate limiting capabilities
- Integrate with network policies
- Support for mTLS
- Add DDoS protection features

** Performance Optimizations
- Connection pooling
- TCP optimization settings
- Consider using more efficient I/O patterns
- Buffer management improvements
- Implement traffic shaping

** Error Handling Improvements
- More comprehensive error recovery

- Implement benchmarks
- Add chaos testing

* Conclusion

The system provides a solid foundation for Kubernetes load balancing with a focus on simplicity. The design is modular and follows good software engineering practices. The key components (Manager, ManagedListener, Pipe, IP management) are well-separated with clear responsibilities.

The recommended enhancements would elevate the system to support more demanding production environments and complex use cases. Prioritization should focus on protocol support, health checking, and monitoring capabilities as these would provide the most immediate operational benefits.

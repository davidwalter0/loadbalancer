* Runtime Configuration Implementation

I've enhanced the loadbalancer project by implementing the following key improvements:

** 1. Link Device Runtime Configuration

The link device is now properly configurable at runtime rather than being initialized statically. This provides greater flexibility for deployment across different environments and simplifies configuration management.

*** Implementation Details

- Removed hardcoded initialization in =mgr/ipmgrinit.go=
- Added explicit Initialize() function that must be called at startup
- Added error handling for missing link device configuration
- Modified the main.go startup sequence to call Initialize()

** 2. Network Interface Listing Functionality

Added a new capability to discover and list available network interfaces, making it easier for operators to:
- Identify valid network interfaces that can be used for load balancing
- View interface properties including addresses and status
- Select the appropriate interface for their environment

*** Implementation Details

- Created =ipmgr/interfaces.go= with new interface listing functions:
  - =ListInterfaces()= - Lists all network interfaces
  - =GetValidInterfaces()= - Filters to show only viable interfaces with IPv4 addresses
- Added a usable example in =examples/listinterfaces/main.go=

** 3. Dependency Challenges

While attempting to update the codebase to use go-cfg/v3, we encountered dependency resolution issues that would require a more substantial refactoring:

- The go-cfg/v3 package has a completely different API structure than the original go-cfg
- It uses a new package path (pkg/config) rather than the root package
- The project would need significant changes to the configuration loading mechanisms

Given these challenges, I've kept the original go-cfg dependency while implementing the runtime configuration improvements. This maintains backward compatibility while still achieving the primary goal of making the link device configurable at runtime.

** 4. Future Improvement Path

For a future update to go-cfg/v3, I recommend:

1. Create a complete mapping of the current go-cfg API usage
2. Develop adapter functions to bridge the old and new APIs
3. Implement a phased migration approach that allows for gradual adoption
4. Add comprehensive tests to verify configuration behavior

The modular changes I've made to the initialization process will make this future migration simpler by decoupling the configuration loading from its application.

* Testing

The changes have been verified through:

1. Build testing to ensure code compiles correctly
2. Runtime functionality testing of interface listing
3. Validation of initialization sequence logic

A full end-to-end test would require deploying in a Kubernetes environment to verify the complete configuration flow with dynamic link device selection.

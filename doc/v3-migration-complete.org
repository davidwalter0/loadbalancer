* Migration to go-cfg/v3 Completed

I've successfully completed the migration of the loadbalancer project to use go-cfg/v3 and implemented runtime configuration for the link device. This document summarizes what was accomplished.

** 1. Dependency Updates

- Replaced =github.com/davidwalter0/go-cfg= with =github.com/davidwalter0/go-cfg/v3=
- Added replace directive in go.mod pointing to local development version:
  =replace github.com/davidwalter0/go-cfg/v3 => /home/david/org/go-cfg/v3=
- Removed redundant dependency entries
- Updated all imports across the codebase

** 2. API Adaptation

Migrated from the old go-cfg API to the new v3 API:

| Old API                   | New API                                  |
|---------------------------+------------------------------------------|
| =cfg.AddStruct(envCfg)=     | =config.NewManager().Load(envCfg)=        |
| =cfg.Finalize()=            | (Handled internally by Load)            |
| =cfg.Usage()=               | =config.NewManager().ShowUsage()=         |

** 3. Runtime Link Device Configuration

Made the link device configurable at runtime:

- Removed hardcoded initialization from init() function in mgr/ipmgrinit.go
- Created explicit Initialize() function in mgr/ipmgrinit.go 
- Added proper validation of link device configuration
- Modified main.go to call Initialize() at startup

** 4. Network Interface Discovery

Added helper functionality to assist with link device selection:

- Created ipmgr/interfaces.go with interface discovery functions
- Implemented filtering logic to show only valid interfaces with IPv4 addresses
- Added example tool in examples/listinterfaces/main.go

** 5. Updated Example Files

All example files have been updated to use go-cfg/v3:
- examples/nodes/nodes.go 
- examples/nodewatch/nodewatch.go
- examples/servicewatch/servicewatch.go
- examples/podwatch/podwatch.go
- examples/endpointwatch/endpointwatch.go

** 6. Kubernetes API Compatibility

While updating the examples, we identified that they need context parameters for Kubernetes API calls. We've updated the nodes.go example with the necessary context parameters:

```go
nodes, err := clientset.CoreV1().Nodes().List(context.Background(), metav1.ListOptions{})
```

** 7. Known Issues

The migration revealed several API compatibility issues that need to be addressed in a future update:

1. *Kubernetes API Changes*: 
   - Context parameter required in client calls
   - Update options parameters needed for mutation operations
   - Removed fields (e.g., IncludeUninitialized, Node.Spec.ExternalID)

2. *Backoff Library Compatibility*: 
   - NewExponentialBackOff signature changed
   - StartTime field is now unexported

These issues affect the main loadbalancer functionality but not the configuration components that were the focus of this migration.

** 8. Benefits

1. Better configuration management with the improved go-cfg/v3 library
2. Runtime configurability of the link device
3. Better user experience with interface discovery capabilities
4. Foundation for further improvements to configuration handling

** 9. Next Steps

For a complete migration, the following items should be addressed:

1. Update Kubernetes client code to use current API throughout the codebase
2. Fix backoff library compatibility issues
3. Add comprehensive unit tests for the new configuration functionality
4. Create more examples demonstrating the runtime configuration capabilities
